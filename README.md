# Brownserve.PuppetModulePSTools
PowerShell module to aid in creating, testing and publishing Brownserve Puppet modules.  
This module is designed to be used within Brownserve projects but it is somewhat flexible so others may find it useful.

## Using the module
Currently we don't release this as an installable module as it's still in testing, you'll need to clone the repo and run it locally for now.
The [`_init.ps1`](.build/_init.ps1) script should get you going.
